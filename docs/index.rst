w9-pathfinding
============================

W9-Pathfinding is a versatile pathfinding library written in C++ with a Python
interface provided by Cython. It offers a variety of pathfinding algorithms for
navigating different types of maps, including grids, graphs, and 3D spaces.
The library includes both classic pathfinding algorithms and multi-agent
pathfinding algorithms.

Key Features:
----------------------------

* Pathfinding Algorithms: Implements classical algorithms like BFS, Dijkstra,
  and A*, as well as multi-agent pathfinding algorithms like CBS and ICTS.
* Multiple Map Types: Works with different map structures, including Graphs
  (directed and undirected), Grids (2D and 3D), Hexagonal Grids (pointy top and flat top).
* Weighted and Unweighted Maps: Supports both weighted and non-weighted maps (graphs and grids).
* Pathfinding with Dynamic Obstacles: Allows pathfinding in environments
  where some agents are dynamic obstaclesâ€”you know their paths but cannot control
  them. It computes optimal paths for the remaining agents while avoiding collisions
  with both dynamic obstacles and each other.

Why "W9"?
----------------------------

The name w9-pathfinding comes from the **weighted 9-connected grid** you can
use for **pathfinding** in the library. The "W" stands for Weighted, indicating
that the library supports both weighted and non-weighted maps, where movement
costs may vary. The "9" refers to the 9 possible movement directions: the 4 cardinal
directions (North, South, East, West), the 4 diagonal directions (NE, SE, SW, NW),
and a center movement (staying in place, which is crucial in multi-agent scenarios).
