# About W9-Pathfinding

W9-Pathfinding is a versatile pathfinding library written in C++ with a Python interface provided by Cython. It offers a variety of pathfinding algorithms for navigating different types of maps, including grids, graphs, and 3D spaces. The library includes both classic pathfinding algorithms and multi-agent pathfinding algorithms.

## Key Features:

- Pathfinding Algorithms: Implements classical algorithms like BFS, Dijkstra, and A*, as well as multi-agent pathfinding algorithms like CBS and ICTS.
- Multiple Map Types: Works with different map structures, including Graphs (directed and undirected), Grids (2D and 3D), Hexagonal Grids (pointy top and flat top).
- Weighted and Unweighted Maps: Supports both weighted and non-weighted maps (graphs and grids).
- Pathfinding with Dynamic Obstacles: Allows pathfinding in environments where some agents are dynamic obstaclesâ€”you know their paths but cannot control them. It computes optimal paths for the remaining agents while avoiding collisions with both dynamic obstacles and each other.

## Why "W9"?

The name w9-pathfinding comes from the **weighted 9-connected grid** you can use for **pathfinding** in the library. The "W" stands for Weighted, indicating that the library supports both weighted and non-weighted maps, where movement costs may vary. The "9" refers to the 9 possible movement directions: the 4 cardinal directions (North, South, East, West), the 4 diagonal directions (NE, SE, SW, NW), and a center movement (staying in place, which is crucial in multi-agent scenarios).
